# <Challenge1>


## Description

> The purpose of this project was to get familiarised with making changes to existing code. 
> The main reason for this challenge was to know more about one of the most important aspects of web development - accessibility.
> The problem I was solving was to improve the code (to make it more accessible) without changing what it does.
> I learned how to write semantic HTML code. How to write correct <alt> descriptions for images and icons and why it's so important. Add comments to improve clarity in the code.
